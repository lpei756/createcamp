# Summer of Tech Create Camp AKL 2023 üåü

Spent the last two days at Summer of Tech's Create Camp, where I had an enriching and unforgettable experience.

## Teammates and Mentors

I met four amazing teammates:
- **William Bryant**
- **N. Erkam Yildirim**
- **Thin Lai Wai Oo**
- **Agnes Lo**

Our diligent mentor:
- **Peter Lee**

Several enthusiastic mobile mentors assisted us, including:
- **Gavin McFall**
- **Noah Irving**
- **April C.**
- A mentor from Pakistan who taught me how to read JSON data.

## Cultural Experience

This was my second time hearing the MƒÅori prayer **Karakia** since arriving in New Zealand. It was also my full-English communication experience, helping me quickly blend into the local atmosphere.

## Team Collaboration

When my team learned I was new, they took special care with their English, slowing down their speech to communicate with me. This inspired me to practice my English listening and speaking skills more to better integrate into local life and work.

During the project, I learned to use the Google Maps API with the help of William and successfully deployed the website to my [GitHub.io](https://lpei756.github.io/createcamp/map.html) page.

## Final Project

During the final group project presentation, I was greatly enlightened. Other teams developed a depression warning system in response to Auckland's rainstorm crisis, perfectly meeting the city's current municipal needs, and rightfully winning first place.

Our group focused on addressing pet owners' needs for dog-friendly places. We learned to use APIs and cooperatively simulated user demand scenarios. The collaboration with William Bryant especially helped me become more adept at using Git's Continuous Integration workflow.

## Conclusion

This experience was unforgettable, and I even made some great friends. I hope we can gather again in the future. A huge thanks to Summer of Tech Create Camp AKL 2023 for this meaningful event. It's been a rewarding journey, and I look forward to more.
